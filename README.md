Skin health has been a public concern especially among youths, and the cost of skin treatment is very expensive. Consultation with a verified skin specialist in Jakarta costs a lot of money, even just for diagnosing the problem. MeSkin could reduce the cost of consulting skin specialists. MeSkin will be the first-ever app to help you diagnose your skin problem only with a photo accurately and efficiently.
